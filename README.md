# jpeg_extractor

//this project extracts jpeg images and fragments (without header) from a given disk. 

//Image_Extractor_v1.0
//This code is implemented by Samet Taspinar
// 10 Dec 2016
// arg[1]: path/to/file from which images will be extracted
// arg[2]: output folder. This one is optional, if the user doesn't input it, a folder, output_folder, 
// will be created and images that are found will be pushed to that folder. 
// A sub-folder, frag will be created under output folder to which image fragments will be saved.

// Note that there are Windows dependencies so the code works in Windows only.
// In the future versions, 
//		- Windows dependencies will be eliminated and the code will be platform independent
//		- Multi-threading will be added 
//		- Various different type of data can be extracted
//			- This will help decrease the false positive rate for the fragments
//		- More vulnerability check, memory and CPU usage analysis (Performance Profiling)
//		- Further experiments with different types of disk images will be done
//		- Different JPEG images might have different type of information, include various types of jpeg files
